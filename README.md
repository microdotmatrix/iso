Ok, time to focus...
### Outline of basic purpose of this project:

- Identify key core utilities and functions (CSS, SCSS, JS)
- Consolidate utilities and functions into a practical toolset
- Establish standardized BEM semantic class/identifier structure
- Define a set of utility classes
- Utilize data-attribute selectors for variable functions and unique identifiers
- Better incorporate responsive design tools/practices to reduce corrective revisions
- Use of CSS custom props and SCSS variables for more consistent theming
- Focus on component based architecture and modular design
- Code commenting
- Dark/Light modes

**Start simple, avoid rabbit holes, etc.**
