// Container
// -----
// I had been a die hard Bourbon user for years, practically since it was first distilled. But I 
// recently found Gerillass, a rather curiously named Sass function library with a few extra tools
// that captured my heart. One being the elegant "adaptive" mixin, which simply generates the
// breakpoints and widths of your container with whatever gutter width you plug into it.
// -----

.container {
   @include adaptive($spacing-unit);
   max-width: $content-width;
}

// Flex Grid + Data-Selectors...
// -----
// I just can't get over semantic styling enough to convert entirely to utility classes... but data-selectors  are fun, especially for anything that is assigned numeric values. And I love flexbox. I'll do some Grid stuff too, but Flex is my jam.

// ^^^ This guy wrote a very handy set of mixins to simplify row and column generation using Sass and Flexbox
// fully decked out with responsive breakpoint functions and generators for utility classes. Here I'll just be
// using the row and column mixins, passing through a @for function to generate data-attribute selectors with
// 12 columns. 
// -----

[data-row="flex"] {
   @include row();
}

$data-columns: 12;

@for $i from 1 through $data-columns {
   [data-column="#{$i}"] {
      @include col($i);
   }
}

[data-column="auto"] {
   @include col();
}
